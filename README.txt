I could not have accomplished this project or attained its desired purpose for it without the open-source libraries provided by Arduino CC and the creators of the pre-defined sounds supplied by "pitches.h".

1. Download the correct Arduino IDE version for your operating system from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.

2a)-WINDOWS USERS-Extract the contents of "arduino-1.8.5-windows" to your desired location--I recommend storing the contents in C:\Program Files (x86) or C:\Program Files for simplicity purposes.

2b)-MAC USERS-Extract the contents of "arduino-1.8.5-macosx" to your desired location.

2c)-ARCH LINUX ARM USERS-Extract the contents of "arduino-1.8.5-linuxarm.tar" to your desired location.

2d)-LINUX 32bit USERS-Extract the contents of "arduino-1.8.5-linux32.tar" to your desired location.

2e)-LINUX 64bit USERS-Extract the contents of "arduino-1.8.5-linux64.tar" to your desired location.

3) Open the "AP_Computer_Science_Principles_Create_Portion" .ino file with the Arduino Application (Arduino.exe).

4) All done!
